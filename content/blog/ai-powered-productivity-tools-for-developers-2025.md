Let’s be honest—being a developer today means juggling a million things at once. Thankfully, AI tools are stepping up to help us work smarter, not harder. Here are some of my favorite AI-powered productivity boosters that can seriously level up your workflow:

- Need to summarize a long meeting or brainstorm some ideas? Notion AI’s got you covered.  
- It helps you automate task lists and keeps your projects neat and tidy.  
- Especially great if you’re working remotely or managing a team.

### 🖥️ [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://github.com/features/copilot/chat)  
*Chat with your code and get instant help.*

- Stuck on a bug? Want to understand a tricky function? Just ask Copilot Chat right inside your editor.  
- Supports tons of languages and frameworks, so it’s super versatile.

### 📅 [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/)  
*Let AI take control of your schedule.*

- Motion can automatically schedule and prioritize your tasks so you don’t have to stress over your to-do list.  
- It integrates with Slack and email, making sure you stay on top of everything without extra hassle.

### 💬 [Slack GPT](https://slack.com/gpt)

### 🚀 What’s Coming Next?

I’m really excited about what’s around the corner:
