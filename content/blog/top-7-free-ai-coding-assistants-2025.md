Backend development has always been about making complex systems work smoothly. Now AI is stepping in to help automate some of the hardest parts:

---

### 🤖 Automated Code Generation  
AI tools can create boilerplate code for APIs, database queries, and serverless functions — saving you time and headache.

---

### 🛠️ Smarter Debugging and Testing  
AI-powered debuggers analyze logs and runtime behavior to spot issues faster. Plus, AI-driven test generators create relevant test cases automatically.

---

### 📊 Predictive Scaling & Monitoring  
AI predicts traffic spikes and scales resources proactively, so your servers never get overwhelmed.

---

### 💡 Intelligent Documentation  
AI keeps your backend docs fresh and accurate, making onboarding and teamwork smoother.
