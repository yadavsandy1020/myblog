Machine learning has come a long way‚Äîand the libraries we rely on are evolving just as fast. Whether you're building deep learning models, experimenting with NLP, or just getting started, these libraries are shaping how we build intelligent systems in 2025:

---

### üß† [TensorFlow 3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
*Still the go-to for production-ready ML.*

- Ideal for building everything from simple models to large-scale neural networks.  
- Optimized for speed with GPU/TPU support.  
- A massive ecosystem of tools, extensions, and tutorials.

---

### ü§ñ [PyTorch 2.0](https://pytorch.org/)  
*A favorite among researchers‚Äîand now production-ready too.*

- Known for its dynamic graph and ease of use.  
- Great for rapid prototyping and scaling up to full deployments.  
- Strong support for both academic and industry use cases.

---

### ‚ö° [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)  
*The easiest way to use powerful NLP and vision models.*

- Huge collection of pretrained models for text, image, and audio tasks.  
- Simplifies fine-tuning with minimal setup.  
- Constantly updated with the latest breakthroughs.

---

### üõ† [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)  
*Reliable and approachable classic ML tools.*

- Perfect for regression, classification, clustering, and more.  
- A consistent API that makes it easy to learn and use.  
- Plays well with Pandas, NumPy, and other core Python libraries.

---

### üåê [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/)  
*High-speed inference across platforms.*

- Run models built in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others‚Äîall in one runtime.  
- Designed for speed and flexibility on CPUs, GPUs, and edge devices.  
- Ideal for teams looking to deploy AI at scale.
